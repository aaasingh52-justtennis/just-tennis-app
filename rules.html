<!-- SECTION 2: REGULAR SEASON - HOW IT WORKS -->

<h2>Regular Season - How It Works</h2>

<h3>Match Format</h3>
<p>Players must agree on format before the match begins.</p>

<p><strong>Format Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>One set</li>
    <li>Best of 3 sets</li>
    <li>Best of 5 sets</li>
</ul>
<p>In Best of 3 or 5: optional 10-point tie-break (win by 2) can replace final set if both agree.</p>

<h3>Scoring & Points System</h3>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Event</th>
        <th>Points</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Match participation</td>
        <td>1 point</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Each set won</td>
        <td>1 point</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Match victory bonus</td>
        <td>2 points</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Maximum per match</strong></td>
        <td><strong>5 points</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Ensures fairness between different formats. Best of 5 match wins are capped to avoid imbalance.</p>

<h4>Max Number of Matches Between the Same Pair</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Players may play the same opponent more than 3 times during the regular season, however only the first 3 reported matches between the same pair will count towards ranking points</li>
    <li>Any matches beyond the 3rd encounter between the same players will not count towards ranking points</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ladder Rankings</h4>

<p><strong>Your ladder position is determined by total points earned.</strong> <strong>For players on the same number of points,</strong> rankings are tiebroken in this order:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Match win/loss percentage</li>
    <li>Set win/loss percentage (only if match W/L% is equal)</li>
    <li>Order of joining the league (only if set W/L% is also equal)</li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>top 16 available players</strong> by ladder rankings qualify for playoffs. On the buffer day (April 2), availability is confirmed. If any players in the top 16 cannot participate, all players below them move up one position in the seedings, and the next available player(s) from the ladder become the new 16th seed (and beyond if needed).</p>

<h3>Match Reporting</h3>
<ol>
    <li>All match results should be reported in the WhatsApp group</li>
    <li>At minimum, report the <strong>number of sets each player won</strong></li>
    <li>Exact scores are optional but encouraged</li>
    <li>Either player may post the result; <strong>it must be acknowledged by the opponent</strong> (e.g. thumbs up)</li>
    <li>Use your assigned Player ID when reporting results</li>
</ol>

<h3>Arranging Matches</h3>

<h4>Court Booking</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Players organize court booking themselves</li>
    <li>Contact details, locations, and player levels are available in the shared contact sheet</li>
</ul>

<h4>Finding Opponents</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Players can arrange matches with whoever they want</li>
    <li>Use the excel sheet to filter by location zones, skill levels, budget and timings to find suitable opponents</li>
    <li>Players can post in the group with specific court bookings/times/locations (be clear about levels and fees)</li>
    <li>Players can directly contact others, but observe proper etiquette (don't message too late at night unless you know the person)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mid-Match Format Changes</h3>
<p>If match duration or court availability is limited, players may modify the format mid-match by mutual agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Switch to a 10-point tie-break instead of a full deciding set</li>
    <li>Start a 2nd/3rd set at 2-2 instead of 0-0</li>
</ul>

<h3>Injury Policy</h3>
<p>If a player is injured mid-match and cannot continue, the uninjured player is awarded all remaining sets.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> In a best of 3 match, if Player A wins the first set but gets injured in the second set and cannot continue, Player B is awarded the second and third sets.</p>

<p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Injured player gets points for participation (1) plus any sets won before injury</li>
    <li>Uninjured player gets full match points as if they won all remaining sets</li>
</ul>

<h3>Late Arrival / Late Cancellation</h3>
<p>If a player is <strong>20+ minutes late</strong> to a scheduled match OR <strong>cancels within 3 hours</strong> of the scheduled start time, the opponent has the <strong>right to enforce a walkover</strong> (though they may choose to show grace and reschedule).</p>

<p><strong>Walkover Scoring:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Present player receives <strong>5 points</strong></li>
    <li>Absent player receives <strong>0 points</strong></li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Players who commit <strong>2 such infractions</strong> (late arrival/short notice cancellation) will be removed from the league.
</div>

<!-- SECTION 2.5: MVP AWARD -->

<h2>MVP Award</h2>

<h3>MVP Nominees</h3>
<p>At the end of the regular season, MVP nominees will be the <strong>3 players who have played the most regular season matches</strong>. If there is a tie for the 3rd spot (or higher), there can be more than 3 nominees.</p>

<h3>Voting Process</h3>
<p>All players on the ladder will have the opportunity to vote for their MVP via a Google Form at the end of the regular season.</p>

<h3>Voting Criteria</h3>
<p><strong>The MVP award is about community contribution, not just tennis ability.</strong></p>

<p>When voting, consider how the nominee adds value to the Just Tennis community through:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Growing the community:</strong> Inviting friends, sharing the group link</li>
    <li><strong>Facilitating matches:</strong> Sharing court bookings with others, helping organize games</li>
    <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Playing with people of different skill levels and backgrounds</li>
    <li><strong>Organizing friendly games:</strong> Taking initiative to bring players together</li>
    <li><strong>Sportsmanship:</strong> Fair play, positive attitude, encouraging opponents</li>
    <li><strong>Community spirit:</strong> Supporting other players, creating a welcoming atmosphere</li>
</ul>

<p>The MVP embodies what Just Tennis is about: building an inclusive, active, and supportive tennis community where everyone feels welcome.</p>

<h3>Award</h3>
<p>The MVP award is funded by optional 20 AED donations during the regular season. The winner receives recognition and a small prize funded by these contributions.</p>

<!-- SECTION 3: PLAYOFFS -->

<h2>Playoffs</h2>

<h3>Prize & Entry Fee</h3>

<p><strong>Playoff participation does</strong> require a 30 AED entry from your own money.</p>

<p><em>Note: The optional 20 AED MVP donation during regular season does not affect playoff qualification.</em></p>

<h3>Desired Prize Distribution</h3>

<p><strong>Here's what we want to achieve:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Everyone puts in <strong>30 AED</strong></li>
    <li>ðŸ¥‡ <strong>Winner receives:</strong> 320 AED</li>
    <li>ðŸ¥ˆ <strong>Runner-up receives:</strong> 160 AED</li>
    <li><strong>Total prize pool:</strong> 480 AED (16 players Ã— 30 AED)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This is equivalent to the following net outcome:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>ðŸ¥‡ <strong>Winner:</strong> +290 AED (receives 320, contributes 30)</li>
    <li>ðŸ¥ˆ <strong>Runner-up:</strong> +130 AED (receives 160, contributes 30)</li>
    <li><strong>Everyone else:</strong> -30 AED (14 players Ã— 30 AED each)</li>
    <li><strong>Net total:</strong> +290 + 130 - 420 = 0 (zero-sum, as it should be)</li>
</ul>

<h3>How the Knockout Payment System Achieves This</h3>

<div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>By entering the playoffs, you agree to the following knockout payment structure:</strong>
</div>

<p>When you <strong>are knocked out of the playoffs</strong>, you must pay the player who eliminated you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your own <strong>30 AED contribution</strong> (the only money you put in from your own pocket)</li>
    <li><strong>Plus any accumulated winnings to that point</strong> (money you've collected from opponents you previously knocked out)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> You only ever put in 30 AED of your own money. Everything beyond that is money you've won from opponents you previously knocked out and are passing forward.</p>

<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> The knockout payment structure ensures that money flows from eliminated players to advancing players, naturally creating the desired 320/160 prize distribution by the final.</p>

<h4>Payment Examples</h4>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Round Knocked Out</th>
        <th>Amount You Pay</th>
        <th>Breakdown</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round of 16</td>
        <td>30 AED</td>
        <td>30 (your own money) + 0 (collected from others)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Redemption Round</td>
        <td>30-60 AED</td>
        <td>30 (your own money) + 0-30 (collected from others in R16, if you won R16)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Quarterfinals</td>
        <td>30-60 AED</td>
        <td>30 (your own money) + 0-30 (collected from others in R16/Redemption)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Semifinals</td>
        <td>60-120 AED</td>
        <td>30 (your own money) + 30-90 (collected from others in previous rounds)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Final</td>
        <td>80 AED (typical)</td>
        <td>From the 240 you hold (210 collected + 30 own), pay 80 to winner to achieve 320/160 split</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><em>Note: The exact amount depends on your path through the tournament. Most quarterfinalists hold 30 AED, but in upset scenarios, some may hold 60 AED. In the Final, if both finalists hold different amounts (e.g., 270 vs 210), the payment adjusts accordingly to maintain the 320/160 outcome. Regardless, you only ever contribute 30 AED of your own money. The worked example with hypothetical playoff results below will illustrate this clearly.</em></p>

<h4>Payment Rules</h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Payment must be completed within 48 hours of being knocked out</strong> (Note: For R16, high-seeded losers are only knocked out after losing redemption round, not after their initial R16 loss. From QF onwards, losing = knocked out immediately.)</li>
    <li><strong>Walkovers/Forfeits:</strong> If a player forfeits or no-shows a playoff match (cannot make the deadline, etc.), they are considered knocked out and must still pay their opponent: 30 AED (own contribution) + any accumulated winnings they hold. This payment rule applies regardless of whether the match was played.</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> A pinned message will be posted by the organizer in the group. Players who are knocked out must thumbs up the pinned message as soon as they have transferred payment to the player who knocked them out</li>
    <li><strong>Payment method:</strong> Direct bank transfer or cash (arranged between players)</li>
</ol>

<h4>Non-Payment Consequences</h4>
<div class="highlight-box">
    <p><strong>Failure to pay within 48 hours of being knocked out results in:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>âŒ Immediate disqualification from all future Just Tennis seasons until payment is made</li>
        <li>âŒ Name posted in group as "payment outstanding"</li>
        <li>âŒ No exceptions</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The organizer will not act as middleman.</strong> Payment responsibility is between players directly.</p>
</div>

<h3>Playoff Format</h3>

<p>The <strong>Top 16 available players</strong> by ladder rankings qualify for playoffs.</p>

<div class="info-box">
    <strong>Availability Requirement:</strong> Playoff seedings are finalized on April 2 (buffer day) after confirming player availability. If any players in the top 16 by ladder rankings cannot participate, all players below them move up one position in the seedings. The next available player(s) from the ladder fill the remaining spots (becoming the new 16th seed, and so on if needed). This ensures no walkovers in the first round and maintains proper seeding order.
</div>

<p>Playoff matches can be any format (1 set, best of 3, or best of 5) depending on players' preference, but <strong>best of 3 is strongly encouraged</strong>. <strong>League final must be best of 3 sets.</strong></p>

<h4>16-Player Format with Redemption Round</h4>

<p><strong>Round of 16:</strong></p>
<p>Traditional seeding: 1v16, 2v15, 3v14, 4v13, 5v12, 6v11, 7v10, 8v9</p>

<p><strong>How players progress after Round of 16:</strong></p>
<p>The 8 matches produce 8 winners and 8 losers. These 16 players are sorted into three groups based on their original seed:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>4 highest-seeded winners</strong> â†’ Advance directly to Quarterfinals</li>
    <li><strong>4 highest-seeded losers + 4 lowest-seeded winners</strong> â†’ Proceed to Redemption Round</li>
    <li><strong>4 lowest-seeded losers</strong> â†’ Eliminated immediately</li>
</ol>

<h3>Playoff Bracket Structure</h3>

<h4>Round of 16</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 vs 16 â†’ Match 1</li>
    <li>2 vs 15 â†’ Match 2</li>
    <li>3 vs 14 â†’ Match 3</li>
    <li>4 vs 13 â†’ Match 4</li>
    <li>5 vs 12 â†’ Match 5</li>
    <li>6 vs 11 â†’ Match 6</li>
    <li>7 vs 10 â†’ Match 7</li>
    <li>8 vs 9 â†’ Match 8</li>
</ul>

<h4>Redemption Round</h4>
<p><em>Determined after R16 results. All 8 redemption participants (4 highest-seeded losers + 4 lowest-seeded winners) are re-seeded by their original seed, then matched 1st vs 8th, 2nd vs 7th, 3rd vs 6th, 4th vs 5th.</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>1st vs 8th â†’ Match 9</li>
    <li>2nd vs 7th â†’ Match 10</li>
    <li>3rd vs 6th â†’ Match 11</li>
    <li>4th vs 5th â†’ Match 12</li>
</ul>

<h4>Quarter Finals</h4>
<p><em>8 players: 4 highest-seeded winners from R16 + 4 redemption round winners. All QF participants are re-seeded by their original seed, then matched 1st vs 8th, 2nd vs 7th, 3rd vs 6th, 4th vs 5th.</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>1st vs 8th â†’ Match 13</li>
    <li>2nd vs 7th â†’ Match 14</li>
    <li>3rd vs 6th â†’ Match 15</li>
    <li>4th vs 5th â†’ Match 16</li>
</ul>

<h4>Semi Finals</h4>
<ul>
    <li>W13 vs W16 â†’ Match 17</li>
    <li>W14 vs W15 â†’ Match 18</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> From Semifinals onwards, matchups follow bracket progression (no re-seeding).</em></p>

<h4>3rd Place Playoff (Optional)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>L17 vs L18 â†’ Match 19 - 3RD PLACE PLAYOFF</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The 3rd place playoff is optional and only played if both semifinal losers agree to compete. If either player declines, the 3rd/4th place rankings are determined by their original ladder seeding.</em></p>

<h4>Final</h4>
<ul>
    <li>W17 vs W18 â†’ Match 20 - FINAL</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
    <strong>Note:</strong> The redemption round gives the 4 highest-seeded losers from Round of 16 a second chance to reach the Quarterfinals. All redemption participants are re-seeded and matched highest vs lowest (same principle as QF). From SF onwards, matches follow bracket progression. An optional 3rd place playoff (if both semifinal losers agree to play) determines final rankings; otherwise, rankings are based on original ladder seeding. No payment is involved in the 3rd place playoff.
</div>

<h4>Redemption Round Details</h4>
<ul>
    <li>8 players compete for the 4 remaining Quarterfinal spots</li>
    <li>All 8 redemption participants are re-seeded by their original ladder seed</li>
    <li>Matchups use highest vs lowest seeding (e.g., if redemption has seeds 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, then 3 plays 14, 5 plays 12, etc.)</li>
    <li>Winners advance to Quarterfinals (joining the 4 highest-seeded winners from R16 who advanced directly)</li>
    <li>Losers are eliminated and make payments</li>
</ul>

<p>Both finalists typically enter holding 210 AED (collected from opponents they knocked out in previous rounds).</p>

<p><strong>Desired outcome (net perspective):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>ðŸ¥‡ <strong>Winner:</strong> +290 AED (receives 320 AED, contributes 30 AED)</li>
    <li>ðŸ¥ˆ <strong>Runner-up:</strong> +130 AED (receives 160 AED, contributes 30 AED)</li>
    <li><strong>Everyone else:</strong> -30 AED (14 players Ã— 30 AED each)</li>
    <li><strong>Net total:</strong> +290 + 130 - 420 = 0 (zero-sum, as it should be)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Simplest way to achieve this (when both finalists hold 210 AED):</strong></p>
<p>Runner-up pays winner 80 AED</p>
<ul>
    <li>ðŸ¥‡ <strong>Winner:</strong> 210 (collected from others) + 30 (own money) + 80 (from runner-up) = 320 AED</li>
    <li>ðŸ¥ˆ <strong>Runner-up:</strong> 210 (collected from others) + 30 (own money) - 80 (paid to winner) = 160 AED</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Both finalists contribute their 30 AED and hold 210 AED from previous wins = 240 AED each. The runner-up paying the winner 80 AED creates a 320/160 split. The knockout payment structure demonstrated throughout this example achieves exact equivalence to this desired net outcome.</p>

<p><em>Note: In extreme upset scenarios, finalists may hold different amounts (e.g., one holds 270 and the other holds 210). In such cases, the payment amount can be adjusted to maintain the zero-sum outcome and achieve the desired 320/160 split.</em></p>

<h4>Key Insights from this Example</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Everyone only puts in 30 AED of their own money:</strong> Regardless of how far you go, you only ever contribute 30 AED from your own pocket. Everything beyond that is money collected from opponents you previously knocked out and passed forward.</li>
    <li><strong>Payments are deferred for redemption participants:</strong> Seeds 3, 5, 8, 10 only pay when eliminated in redemption (not immediately after losing R16)</li>
    <li><strong>Redemption payment amount is always 30 AED:</strong> It's still effectively Round of 16, so eliminated players only pay their 30 AED contribution</li>
    <li><strong>Full re-seeding creates fair matchups:</strong> In redemption, all 8 participants (3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14) were re-seeded, creating matchups like 3 vs 14, 5 vs 12, etc. Same principle applies in QF.</li>
    <li><strong>No re-seeding after QF:</strong> Semifinals, 3rd place playoff, and Final follow bracket progression (no re-seeding).</li>
    <li><strong>3rd place playoff is optional with no payment:</strong> Semifinal losers already made their payments when knocked out of championship contention. If both players agree to compete in the 3rd place match, it determines final rankings; otherwise, rankings are based on original ladder seeding.</li>
    <li><strong>Quarterfinalists typically hold 30 AED:</strong> In this example, all 8 quarterfinalists hold 30 AED. However, in extreme upset scenarios where low-seeded winners beat low-seeded losers who are immediately eliminated, some QF players could hold 60 AED</li>
    <li><strong>Highest-seeded losers get a second chance:</strong> The 4 highest-seeded losers from R16 (in this case: 3, 5, 8, 10) go to redemption instead of being eliminated immediately</li>
    <li><strong>Lowest-seeded winners must prove themselves:</strong> The 4 lowest-seeded winners from R16 (in this case: 7, 9, 12, 14) must win redemption to advance to QF</li>
</ul>
<h3>Playoff Match Arrangements</h3>

<h4>Round Deadlines</h4>
<p>Each playoff round has strict deadlines. <strong>Players who cannot complete matches on time will forfeit.</strong></p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Round</th>
        <th>Deadline</th>

        <td>Friday, April 3 - Wednesday, April 8</td>

    </tr>
</table>

<h4>Court Booking</h4>
<p>Since playoff matchups are mandatory, the following court booking rules apply:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>If either player cannot afford or does not wish to pay for private court fees,</strong> the match must be played at free public park courts (or free residential courts if either player has access to one)</li>
    <li>If one player prefers a paid facility while the other wants free courts, the match shall be played at a free public park or residential court <strong>unless the player requesting the paid facility agrees to cover both players' court fees</strong></li>
    <li>This ensures tennis remains accessible regardless of budget</li>
</ul>

<h4>Timing Flexibility</h4>
<p>While deadlines must be met, players have flexibility within each round's window to schedule their specific match time. <strong>Quarterfinals, Semifinals, and Finals</strong> offer more time per match than earlier rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Round of 16 (April 3-8) and Redemption Round (April 9-12) are both non-negotiable. If you cannot play during these windows, do not enter the playoffs.</p>

<h2>Decision-Making Authority</h2>

<h3>Collaborative Input</h3>
<p>I value community input and will continue seeking feedback on key decisions like season length and playoff timing through polls and group discussion.</p>
<p>Where the <strong>vast majority</strong> has timing conflicts, I'm willing to adjust playoff dates by up to <strong>one week</strong> after initially setting them.</p>

<h3>Final Authority</h3>
<p>However, <strong>all final decisions regarding rules, playoff formats, seeding, draws, and league operations rest solely with me as the organizer.</strong></p>

<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Playoff bracket and seedings</li>
    <li>Match scheduling deadlines</li>
    <li>Dispute resolution</li>
    <li>Discretionary timing adjustments for playoff participants</li>
</ul>

<p>Feedback is always welcome through direct communication or group discussion, but <strong>toxic behavior, false accusations, or private campaigns to undermine the league will not be tolerated.</strong></p>
